    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>Celine Health Technologies ("Celine," "we," "our," or "us") provides AI-supported triage and intake workflow software for healthcare organizations. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect personal data when patients, staff, and organizations use our triage chat platform and related services.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patient-provided data:</strong> symptoms, demographic details, health context, and free-text triage messages entered during chat interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational metadata:</strong> conversation identifiers, timestamps, session events, triage decisions, escalation events, and device/browser information.</li>
      <li><strong>Organization account data:</strong> administrator names, contact details, user credentials, and customer support communications.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance logs:</strong> records created for auditability, quality assurance, incident response, and legal/regulatory obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver triage intake, patient-routing, and escalation workflows requested by healthcare organizations.</li>
      <li>Support clinical operations by generating structured summaries and handoff context for authorized human reviewers.</li>
      <li>Maintain platform reliability, monitor safety outcomes, troubleshoot incidents, and improve workflow performance.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations, contractual requirements, and healthcare data governance policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis and Role of the Parties</h2>
    <p>In most deployments, the healthcare organization is the data controller for patient information, and Celine acts as a processor or service provider. We process personal data only as needed to deliver contracted services and according to documented instructions from the customer, except where required by law.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authorized healthcare personnel:</strong> triage outputs and escalation details are shared with designated clinical or operational staff.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> trusted infrastructure or support vendors may process data under confidentiality and security obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal disclosures:</strong> we may disclose data when required by law, court order, or to protect health, safety, and legal rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell patient personal data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data for the period required to provide services, satisfy contractual commitments, maintain audit history, and meet legal or regulatory obligations. Retention periods may vary by customer configuration and jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>6. Security Safeguards</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and organizational controls designed to protect data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, and alteration. Controls may include encryption in transit, role-based access, audit trails, and restricted administrative access.</p>

    <h2>7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Where data is transferred across borders, we apply contractual and technical safeguards appropriate to the applicable legal framework, including standard contractual mechanisms where required.</p>

    <h2>8. Patient and User Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on jurisdiction, individuals may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of personal data. Requests should generally be directed to the healthcare organization responsible for the patient relationship; we assist customers with rights requests as required by law and contract.</p>

    <h2>9. Children and Sensitive Health Data</h2>
    <p>Our services are intended for healthcare contexts where sensitive health data is expected. Organizations must implement appropriate consent and guardian workflows for pediatric use, and urgent symptoms should always be escalated through emergency care channels when clinically indicated.</p>

    <h2>10. Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, operational, or technical changes. Material updates will be posted with a revised effective date.</p>
