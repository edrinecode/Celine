      <li>The Services are not emergency services and do not guarantee clinical outcomes.</li>
      <li>Users must seek immediate emergency assistance for life-threatening symptoms or urgent conditions.</li>
      <li>Final clinical decisions remain the responsibility of licensed healthcare professionals and the customer organization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Customer Responsibilities</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>Customers and users must not misuse the Services, attempt unauthorized access, interfere with platform integrity, upload malicious content, or use the platform in violation of applicable law, patient rights, or third-party rights.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Processing and Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Data processing is governed by applicable agreements between Celine and the customer, including any data processing addendum. Each party agrees to maintain appropriate confidentiality measures for protected and sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>6. Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>We aim to provide reliable service availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may update features, workflows, or infrastructure to improve performance, safety, or legal compliance.</p>

    <h2>7. Fees and Subscription Packages</h2>
    <p>Access to paid Services is subject to the applicable subscription package, billing terms, and order documentation. Failure to pay fees may result in suspension or limitation of Services as permitted by contract and law.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Celine and its licensors retain all rights in the Services, software, trademarks, and related materials. Customers retain rights to their data as set forth in their agreements.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Celine is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to fees paid for the Services during the agreed claim period, except where non-excludable liability applies.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>Each party agrees to indemnify the other for third-party claims arising from its own breach of law, negligence, misuse, or contractual breach, subject to agreed procedures and limitations.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate according to the applicable service agreement. Upon termination, access rights end and data handling follows contractual retention and deletion provisions.</p>
